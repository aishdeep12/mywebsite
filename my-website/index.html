                <p>Hi, I'm Aishdeep Kharbanda, a Senior Data Engineer at one of the US banks. Thank you for visiting my page. Let me give you a brief overview of my background.</p>
                <p>With over 5 years of industry experience, I specialize in Data Analytics and Data Engineering. My expertise includes working with ETL processes, developing workflows, and managing data pipelines. I am proficient in Python, Java, and R, and have a strong ability to write efficient code for data processing.</p>
                <p>I possess a deep understanding of both SQL and NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, and excel at crafting and optimizing complex queries. My experience encompasses big data frameworks, container technologies, and DevOps tools, such as Jenkins, OpenShift, Splunk, Docker, Airflow, Kubernetes, Apache Hadoop, and Apache Spark. Additionally, I am skilled in cloud platforms like AWS, Snowflake, and Firebase, which enhances my ability to deliver robust and scalable solutions. I also have significant experience in data visualization and sentiment analysis, enabling me to effectively interpret and present data insights.</p>
